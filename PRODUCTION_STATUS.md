    "isVerified", "isActive", "createdAt", "updatedAt"
) VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(),
    'admin@iwanyu.com',
    '$2b$12$LQv3c1yqBwEHMBkIgSn8A.8kBqt2JzD3r5q9z8w3u4v6x8y0z1a2b3c',
    'Admin',
    'User',
    '+250788000000',
    'ADMIN',
    true,
    true,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
);
```

**Admin Login**: `admin@iwanyu.com` / `admin123`
