# Logo Image Placeholder

The Iwanyu logo has been updated to use a new SVG-based component that matches the provided design.

To use the actual PNG logo image:
1. Save the provided logo image as `iwanyu-logo.png` in the `src/assets/` directory
2. Update the IwanyuLogo component to use the image instead of SVG

Current implementation uses an SVG recreation of the logo design with:
- Orange shopping bag icon
- Clean typography
- Responsive sizing
- Proper spacing and alignment

The logo is now used in:
- Navbar (main and clean versions)
- Footer
- All branding locations throughout the app
